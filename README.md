SQL Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of global layoffs from 2020 to 2023. The primary goal was to understand trends and patterns in company layoffs by cleaning a raw dataset and extracting meaningful business insights. It is structured in two main parts: data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), both of which were performed entirely using MySQL. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed records of layoffs across various industries, countries, funding stages, and company types.


 Objectives

The main objective of this project was to simulate a real-world data analyst task — transforming a messy dataset into a clean, structured format and analyzing it to generate useful business insights. I aimed to practice hands-on data cleaning techniques in SQL and enhance my ability to handle incomplete, inconsistent, and duplicated data. Additionally, this project served as a platform to sharpen my SQL querying and logic-building skills. From a business perspective, the goal was to understand the broader economic patterns associated with tech layoffs — identifying which companies and industries were most affected, when layoffs peaked, how funding stage correlated with workforce reduction, and which regions saw the most job losses. 


 Conclusion

Completing this project gave me practical experience in SQL-based data transformation and insight generation. By working through the entire pipeline of data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I improved my ability to write efficient, accurate SQL queries for business reporting. Some of the most interesting findings included the fact that several well-funded startups like Quibi and BritishVolt still experienced complete workforce layoffs, showing that large investments don’t always prevent business failure. Tech, finance, and crypto were the most affected sectors, with a large concentration of layoffs coming from cities like San Francisco and New York. The year 2023 marked the peak in layoffs, based on the monthly trends I analyzed.
