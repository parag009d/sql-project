# layoffs data cleaning and exploratory data anaysis using sql


## Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analytics solution using **MySQL** on a real-world dataset about company layoffs from 2020 to 2023. The main goal is to analyze global layoff patterns, clean raw and inconsistent data, and extract key business insights using structured SQL queries. The project simulates the role of a data analyst in transforming business data into actionable intelligence — without using Python, R, or visualization tools.

## Objectives

- Clean and standardize raw layoff data using SQL only.
- Analyze total layoffs by year, country, company, industry, and startup stage.
- Identify companies with 100% layoffs and understand their funding impact.
- Calculate rolling monthly layoff trends to find peak layoff periods.
- Rank top companies by layoffs for each year using window functions.
